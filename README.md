# Data_Collecting
Use  beautiful soap for collecting data from web page
I wrote code that you can collect data from one web page 

1)in the first one named "Web_Scaping_One_Table" you can get all data from one desired table just modify the url and number of your table number in code and run it.

2) In Scound you one named "Web_Scraping_All_Tables" you can save all table in that url in separated csv files.
